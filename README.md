SPAM-classifier

A vibe-coded spam classifier using BERT, built with Jupyter Notebook.
Overview

This project leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify messages as spam or not spam. The main goal is to provide a robust and accurate model for spam detection, making use of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.
Features

    Utilizes BERT for advanced text understanding
    Built and trained in Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation
    Clear and organized code for reproducibility
    Customizable for various spam datasets

Requirements

    Python 3.7+
    Jupyter Notebook
    PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the BERT implementation)
    Transformers library (pip install transformers)
    pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/hiki-uwu/SPAM-classifier.git
cd SPAM-classifier

Install dependencies:
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash

    jupyter notebook

    Then open the main notebook and follow the instructions to load data, train, and evaluate the model.

Usage

    Prepare your dataset (CSV, etc.) with labeled spam/not-spam messages.
    Update the notebook with your data path and run the cells to train the classifier.
    Use the trained model to classify new messages.
